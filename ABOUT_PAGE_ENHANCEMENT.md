- [ ] Maintain all existing text content exactly as written
- [ ] Test locally: `npm run build && npm run type-check && npm run lint`
- [ ] **DEPLOY**: Commit with message "Add expandable journey cards to About page"
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Check live site immediately after deployment
- [ ] **ROLLBACK PLAN**: `git revert HEAD` if any issues

### **Integration Step 3: Mission Section**

- [ ] Maintain all existing contact information and functionality
- [ ] Test locally: `npm run build && npm run type-check && npm run lint`
- [ ] **DEPLOY**: Commit with message "Enhance contact form with validation and animations"
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Check live site immediately after deployment
- [ ] **ROLLBACK PLAN**: `git revert HEAD` if any issues

## **PHASE 3: POLISH & OPTIMIZATION**
*Final enhancements after core functionality is deployed*

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] Add scroll-triggered animations for section entrances
- [ ] Implement smooth scroll navigation between sections  
- [ ] Optimize animations for mobile touch interactions
- [ ] Add gentle transitions between all interactive states
- [ ] Ensure all animations are touch-friendly on mobile
- [ ] **FINAL DEPLOY & TEST**: Complete responsive testing

---

## **üõ°Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT SAFETY CHECKLIST**
*Follow for EVERY component and integration step*

```bash
# Before EVERY commit:
npm run build        # ‚úÖ Must pass without errors
npm run type-check   # ‚úÖ Must pass without TypeScript issues  
npm run lint         # ‚úÖ Must pass without syntax problems

# Only commit if ALL THREE pass:
git add .
git commit -m "[Specific feature description]"
git push origin main

# Immediately after push:
# 1. Check Vercel dashboard for successful build ‚úÖ
# 2. Test the specific feature on live site ‚úÖ
# 3. Verify no existing features broke ‚úÖ
```

## **üìã COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE NOTES**

### **Following Proven Patterns**
- **Animation Strategy**: Use JavaScript-based transforms like BookCardFresh.tsx
- **Component Structure**: Follow existing Card.tsx and Button.tsx patterns
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Use 'use client' directive for interactive elements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic version works, animations enhance

### **Deployment-Safe Animation Examples**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SAFE: Use basic transforms that survive build optimization
transform: isHovered ? 'translateY(-8px) scale(1.02)' : 'translateY(0px) scale(1)'
transition: 'all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)'

// ‚ùå AVOID: Complex 3D transforms may be stripped
transform: 'rotateX(15deg) rotateY(-15deg) translateZ(30px)'
```
