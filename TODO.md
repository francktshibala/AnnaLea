## üõ°Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT BEST PRACTICES

**ALWAYS Follow This Process:**

```bash
# Before any commit:
npm run build        # Catch build errors locally
npm run type-check   # Catch TypeScript issues  
npm run lint         # Catch syntax problems

# Test the specific feature you built
# Only commit if ALL tests pass
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: specific description"
git push
```

**Incremental Deployment Strategy:**
1. **Build one sub-task at a time**
2. **Test locally before committing**
3. **Deploy and verify each small change**
4. **Don't batch multiple features in one commit**

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

**Is using separate chats a good idea?** 
‚úÖ **YES, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** because:

1. **Focused Context** - Each chat can focus on one specific feature
2. **Clear Instructions** - You can copy the exact task breakdown 
3. **Faster Iteration** - No need to re-explain the full project context
4. **Better Debugging** - Isolated problem-solving per feature
5. **Knowledge Transfer** - Each implementation builds your understanding

**How to Use This Document:**
1. **Copy the specific Priority section** you want to work on
2. **Start new chat** with: "I'm working on [Priority X] for Anna Lea website. Here's the context and task breakdown: [paste section]"
3. **Include**: "Follow the deployment best practices from CLAUDE.md"
4. **Work through each sub-task incrementally**
