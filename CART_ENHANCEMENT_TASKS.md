## Implementation Guidelines

### Animation Standards (Based on BookCardFresh.tsx)
```typescript
// ✅ SAFE: Deployment-proven transforms
transform: isHovered ? 'translateY(-8px) scale(1.03)' : 'translateY(0px) scale(1)'
transition: 'all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)'
boxShadow: isHovered ? '0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)' : '0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)'
```

### Component Structure Pattern
1. **Start with static version**
2. **Add hover state management**
3. **Implement smooth animations**
4. **Test with npm run build**
5. **Deploy and verify**

### Deployment Safety Checklist
- [ ] Only use translateY, scale, and opacity transforms
- [ ] Test locally with production build
- [ ] Add debug indicator for deployment verification
- [ ] Monitor Vercel build logs
- [ ] Test on live URL immediately after deploy
